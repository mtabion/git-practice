// Pricing:
// Goombas: 5 Coins
// Bob-ombs: 7 Coins
// Cheep-cheeps: 11 Coins

//I always put snippets of the instructions in comments 
//to make sure i don't forget anything. Is that fine with you?

//Also I usually create all of my html right here too. 
//Because i don't like how to select by class or tag creates arrays. 
//And i personally think IDs should be for specific things.
//But i can work either way. 
//Which method do you prefer? 

//I would create a loop that creates all elements necessary for each pest. 
//I never create them individually. 
//we can use if statements or an extra array to apply specific classes or ids for selecting  later. 
//We can also use a class constructor to create the baddies. 
//Each pest will have the same requirements, 
//so looks like they would be perfect for each being an object with common properties. 
//or we can do them all in html?
